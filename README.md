# JIRA Selected Issues Copy

JIRA Selected Issues Copy is a Chrome extension that allows users to select JIRA tickets on a JIRA website and copy their links to the clipboard. When multiple tickets are selected, the links are generated as an HTML bullet point list with labels that include the ticket number (e.g. MYPROJECT-123) and the title of the ticket. When a single ticket is selected, only a link to that ticket is copied.

## Features

- Select JIRA tickets and copy their links to the clipboard.
